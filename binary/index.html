    <h1>Understanding Binary and Decimal Numbers</h1>

    <h2>What is a Binary Number?</h2>
    <p>
      A binary number is a number expressed in the base-2 numeral system, which uses only two digits: 0 and 1. This system is extensively used in computers and digital systems because it is the simplest form of representing numbers electronically, using only two states (on and off).

    <h2>Decimal to Binary Conversion</h2>
    <p>
      Decimal numbers (base-10) use digits from 0 to 9, and to convert a decimal number to binary (base-2), you repeatedly divide the number by 2 and record the remainders. For example, the decimal number 10 is written as 1010 in binary.

    <h2>Binary to Decimal Conversion</h2>
    <p>
      To convert a binary number back to decimal, you multiply each bit by 2 raised to the power of its position, starting from 0 on the right. For example, the binary number 1010 equals the decimal number 10.

    <h2>Why Do We Use Binary Numbers?</h2>
    <p>
      Binary numbers are crucial in computer science because computers operate on electrical signals that have two states: on (1) and off (0). This makes binary the most efficient system for computers to process and store data. The simplicity of binary arithmetic (just 0s and 1s) also leads to faster computations and error detection.

    <h2>Applications of Binary Numbers</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Programming languages like C++, Java, and Python use binary at their core.</li>
      <li>Binary numbers are the foundation of all computer operations and data processing.</li>
      <li>Digital systems, such as mobile phones and calculators, rely on binary operations to function.</li>
      <li>In electronics, binary signals control everything from circuits to communication protocols.</li>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Binary numbers play a vital role in modern technology. They are easy to use in digital systems and are fundamental in computer science and electronics. Understanding how to convert between decimal and binary numbers is crucial for anyone interested in these fields.
